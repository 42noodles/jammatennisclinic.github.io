						<h2><strong>Who are we?</strong></h2>
						<p>We're a group of high school students who we were brought together by an amazing coach named Francois
						<br />
						when we were growing up. Francois has had a tremendous impact on our lives, and in honor of this impact he's had on us,
						<br />
						we're putting on weekly Saturday tennis clinics from 3-4pm at _____ just like he did when we were young.
						<br />
						We hope to spread the love for the sport that he instilled in us, especially during the challenging times we're in right now.

In my free time before quarantine, I also enjoyed running and playing video games, and I am currently also part of the Mountain View Speech and Debate and Mock Trial teams. I’m a firm believer in biting, not stringing, cheese, and I’ll gladly have a discussion about it if you believe different! I’m excited to help people learn and pursue tennis, so I hope to see you out in the courts!</p>
