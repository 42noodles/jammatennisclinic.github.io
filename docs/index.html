										<p>Hello! I’m Archer and a current junior at Mountain View High School. I’ve been playing tennis for more than 6 years and I played on the Mountain View team last season. In my free time before quarantine, I also enjoyed running and playing video games, and I am currently also part of the Mountain View Speech and Debate and Mock Trial teams. I’m a firm believer in biting, not stringing, cheese, and I’ll gladly have a discussion about it if you believe different! I’m excited to help people learn and pursue tennis, so I hope to see you out in the courts!</p>
